# S72_Aayush_Capstone_FolliCure
FolliCure is a personalized haircare web platform that uses user input and AI analysis to recommend custom haircare routines and products. Users will complete a short quiz about their hair type, scalp condition, lifestyle, and preferences. Based on their answers, the system will generate tailored product suggestions and care tips, integrating machine learning to improve recommendations over time.

The project aims to bridge the gap between generic haircare advice and truly personalized solutions.
